# Batch Stories Workflow

**Author:** Jonah Schulte (leveraging BMAD Method)

---

## Critical Prerequisites

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read before running batch-stories!**

**BEFORE running batch-stories:**

### ✅ 1. All stories must be properly generated

- Run: `/create-story-with-gap-analysis` for each story
- Do NOT create skeleton/template files manually
- Validation: `./scripts/validate-all-stories.sh`

**Why:** Agents CANNOT invoke `/create-story-with-gap-analysis` workflow. Story generation requires user interaction and context-heavy codebase scanning.

### ✅ 2. All stories must have 12 BMAD sections

Required sections:
1. Business Context
2. Current State
3. Acceptance Criteria
4. Tasks/Subtasks
5. Technical Requirements
6. Architecture Compliance
7. Testing Requirements
8. Dev Agent Guardrails
9. Definition of Done
10. References
11. Dev Agent Record
12. Change Log

### ✅ 3. All stories must have tasks

- At least 3 unchecked tasks (minimum for valid story)
- Zero-task stories will be skipped
- Validation: `grep -c "^- \[ \]" story-file.md`

### Common Failure Mode: Batch Regeneration

**What you might try:**
```
1. Create 20 skeleton story files (just headers + widget lists)
2. Run /batch-stories
3. Expect agents to regenerate them
```

**What happens:**
- Agents identify stories are incomplete
- Agents correctly halt per story-pipeline validation
- Stories get skipped (not regenerated)
- You waste time

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Generate all stories (1-2 days, manual)
/create-story-with-gap-analysis  # For each story

# 2. Validate (30 seconds, automated)
./scripts/validate-all-stories.sh

# 3. Execute (4-8 hours, parallel autonomous)
/batch-stories
```

See: `AGENT-LIMITATIONS.md` for full documentation on what agents can and cannot do.

### 4. Swarm Mode Prerequisites (Parallel Mode)

> **NEW in v4.0.0:** Parallel mode now uses TeammateTool swarm coordination instead of wave-based Task polling.

**Required:** A swarm-patched Claude Code variant that enables TeammateTool features.

**How to get swarm mode:**
1. Install [claude-sneakpeek](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-sneakpeek) (or equivalent)
2. Create a variant: `npx claude-sneakpeek create --provider <provider> --name <name>`
3. The variant automatically patches Claude Code to enable swarm features
4. Run batch-stories using the variant command (e.g., `claudesp`) instead of `claude`

**What swarm mode enables:**
- `TeammateTool` — Create/manage teams (`spawnTeam`, `cleanup`)
- `SendMessage` — Direct messaging between agents (completion reports, failure alerts)
- `TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList` — Shared task list with dependency constraints
- `Task` with `team_name` param — Spawn teammates that join the swarm

**Verify swarm mode is active:**
```bash
# Check if cli.js is patched
grep "function sU(){return" ~/.claude-sneakpeek/<variant>/npm/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js
# Should show: function sU(){return!0}  (enabled)
```

**Sequential mode does NOT require swarm mode** — it runs in the main Claude context.

## Overview

Interactive batch workflow for processing multiple `ready-for-dev` stories sequentially or in parallel using the story-pipeline with full quality gates.

**New in v1.2.0:** Smart Story Validation & Auto-Creation - validates story files, creates missing stories, regenerates invalid ones automatically.
**New in v1.1.0:** Smart Story Reconciliation - automatically verifies story accuracy after each implementation.

---

## Features

### Core Capabilities

1. **🆕 Smart Story Validation & Auto-Creation** (NEW v1.2.0)
   - Validates all selected stories before processing
   - Checks for 12 required BMAD sections
   - Validates content quality (Current State ≥100 words, gap analysis present)
   - **Auto-creates missing story files** with codebase gap analysis
   - **Auto-regenerates invalid stories** (incomplete or stub files)
   - Interactive prompts (or fully automated with settings)
   - Backups existing files before regeneration

2. **Interactive Story Selection**
   - Lists all `ready-for-dev` stories from sprint-status.yaml
   - Shows story status icons (✅ file exists, ❌ missing, 🔄 needs status update)
   - Supports flexible selection syntax: single, ranges, comma-separated, "all"
   - Optional epic filtering (process only Epic 3 stories, etc.)

3. **Execution Modes**
   - **Sequential:** Process stories one-by-one in current session (easier monitoring)
   - **Parallel (Swarm Mode):** Spawn Heracles teammates via TeammateTool that self-schedule from a shared task list. Workers dynamically claim unblocked stories — no wave planning needed. Requires swarm-patched Claude Code.
   - Configurable worker count: default 3 (set via `swarm_config.max_workers` in workflow.yaml)

4. **Full Quality Gates** (from story-pipeline)
   - Pre-gap analysis (validate story completeness)
   - Test-driven implementation
   - Post-validation (verify requirements met)
   - Multi-agent code review (4 specialized agents)
   - Targeted git commits
   - Definition of done verification

5. **Smart Story Reconciliation** (v1.1.0)
   - Automatically checks story accuracy after implementation
   - Verifies Acceptance Criteria checkboxes match Dev Agent Record
   - Verifies Tasks/Subtasks checkboxes match implementation
   - Verifies Definition of Done completion
   - Updates story status (done/review/in-progress) based on actual completion
   - Synchronizes sprint-status.yaml with story file status
   - **Prevents "done" stories with unchecked items** ✅

---

## Smart Story Validation & Auto-Creation (NEW v1.2.0)

### What It Does

Before processing any selected stories, the workflow automatically validates each story file:

1. **File Existence Check** - Verifies story file exists (tries multiple naming patterns)
2. **Section Validation** - Ensures all 12 BMAD sections are present
3. **Content Quality Check** - Validates sufficient content (not stubs):
   - Current State: ≥100 words
   - Gap analysis markers: ✅/❌ present
   - Acceptance Criteria: ≥3 items
   - Tasks: ≥5 items
4. **Auto-Creation** - Creates missing stories with codebase gap analysis
5. **Auto-Regeneration** - Regenerates invalid/incomplete story files

### Why This Matters

**Problem this solves:**

Before v1.2.0:
```
User: "Process stories 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4"
Workflow: "Story 3.3 file missing - please create it first"
User: Ctrl+C → /create-story → /batch-stories again
```

After v1.2.0:
```
User: "Process stories 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4"
Workflow: "Story 3.3 missing - create it? (yes)"
User: "yes"
Workflow: Creates story 3.3 with gap analysis → Processes all 4 stories
```

**Prevents:**
- Incomplete story files being processed
- Missing gap analysis
- Stub files (< 100 words)
- Manual back-and-forth workflow interruptions

### Validation Process

```
Load Sprint Status

       ↓
🆕 VALIDATE EACH STORY  ← NEW STEP 2.5
       ↓
For each story:
  ┌─ File missing? → Prompt: "Create story with gap analysis?"
  │  └─ yes → /create-story-with-gap-analysis → ✅ Created
  │  └─ no → ⏭️ Skip story
  │
  ┌─ File exists but invalid?
  │  (< 12 sections OR < 100 words OR no gap analysis)
  │  → Prompt: "Regenerate story with codebase scan?"
  │  └─ yes → Backup original → /create-story-with-gap-analysis → ✅ Regenerated

### Configuration Options

**In workflow.yaml:**

```yaml
# Story validation settings (NEW in v1.2.0)
validation:
  enabled: true                   # Enable/disable validation
  auto_create_missing: false      # Auto-create without prompting (use cautiously)
  auto_regenerate_invalid: false  # Auto-regenerate without prompting (use cautiously)
  min_sections: 12                # BMAD format requires all 12
  min_current_state_words: 100    # Minimum content length
  require_gap_analysis: true      # Must have ✅/❌ markers
  backup_before_regenerate: true  # Create .backup before regenerating
```

**Interactive Mode (default):**
- Prompts before creating/regenerating each story
- Safe, user retains control
- Recommended for most workflows

**Fully Automated Mode:**
```yaml
validation:
  auto_create_missing: true
  auto_regenerate_invalid: true
```
- Creates/regenerates without prompting
- Faster for large batches
- Use with caution (may overwrite valid stories)

## Smart Story Reconciliation (v1.1.0)

### What It Does

After each story completes, the workflow automatically:

1. **Loads Dev Agent Record** - Reads implementation summary, file list, test results
2. **Analyzes Acceptance Criteria** - Checks which ACs have evidence of completion
3. **Analyzes Tasks** - Verifies which tasks have been implemented
4. **Analyzes Definition of Done** - Confirms quality gates passed
5. **Calculates Completion %** - AC%, Tasks%, DoD% percentages
6. **Determines Correct Status:**
   - `done`: AC≥95% AND Tasks≥95% AND DoD≥95%
   - `review`: AC≥80% AND Tasks≥80% AND DoD≥80%
   - `in-progress`: Below 80% on any category
7. **Updates Story File** - Checks/unchecks boxes to match reality
8. **Updates sprint-status.yaml** - Synchronizes status entry

### Why This Matters

**Problem this solves:**

Story 20.8 (before reconciliation):
- Dev Agent Record: "COMPLETE - 10 files created, 37 tests passing"
- Acceptance Criteria: All unchecked ❌
- Tasks: All unchecked ❌
- Definition of Done: All unchecked ❌
- sprint-status.yaml: `ready-for-dev` ❌
- **Reality:** Story was 100% complete but looked 0% complete!

**After reconciliation:**
- Acceptance Criteria: 17/18 checked ✅
- Tasks: 24/24 checked ✅
- Definition of Done: 24/25 checked ✅
- sprint-status.yaml: `done` ✅
- **Accurate representation of actual completion** ✅

### Reconciliation Process

```
Implementation Complete
         ↓
Load Dev Agent Record
         ↓
Parse: Implementation Summary, File List, Test Results, Completion Notes
         ↓
For each checkbox in ACs/Tasks/DoD:
  - Search Dev Agent Record for evidence
  - Determine expected status (checked/unchecked/partial)
  - Compare actual vs expected
  - Record discrepancies
         ↓
Calculate completion percentages:
  - AC: X/Y checked (Z%)
  - Tasks: X/Y checked (Z%)
  - DoD: X/Y checked (Z%)
         ↓
Determine correct story status (done/review/in-progress)
         ↓
Apply changes (with user confirmation):
  - Update checkboxes in story file
  - Update story status header
  - Update sprint-status.yaml entry
         ↓
Report final completion statistics
```

### Reconciliation Output

```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Process all ready-for-dev stories
/batch-stories

# Follow prompts:
# 1. See list of ready stories
# 2. Select stories to process (1,3-5,8 or "all")
# 3. Choose execution mode (sequential/parallel)
# 4. Confirm execution plan
# 5. Stories process automatically with reconciliation
# 6. Review batch summary
```

### Epic Filtering

```bash
# Only process Epic 3 stories
/batch-stories filter_by_epic=3
```

### Selection Syntax

```
Single: 1
Multiple: 1,3,5
Range: 1-5 (processes 1,2,3,4,5)
Mixed: 1,3-5,8 (processes 1,3,4,5,8)
All: all (processes all ready-for-dev stories)
```

### Execution Modes

**Sequential (Recommended for ≤5 stories):**
- Processes one story at a time in current session
- Easier to monitor progress
- Lower resource usage
- Can pause/cancel between stories

**Parallel / Swarm Mode (Recommended for >5 stories):**
- Spawns Heracles teammates via TeammateTool swarm
- Workers self-schedule: claim unblocked tasks, execute pipeline, report results, claim next
- Dependencies enforced via task graph constraints (no rigid waves)
- Zero idle time — workers grab the next available story immediately
- Requires swarm-patched Claude Code (e.g., `claudesp` from claude-sneakpeek)
- Configure worker count in `workflow.yaml` → `swarm_config.max_workers` (default: 3)

---

## Workflow Configuration

**File:** `_bmad/pantheon/workflows/batch-stories/workflow.yaml`

### Key Settings

```yaml
# Safety limits
max_stories: 20  # Won't process more than 20 in one batch

# Pacing
pause_between_stories: 5  # Seconds between stories (sequential mode)

# Error handling
continue_on_failure: true  # Keep processing if one story fails

# Reconciliation (NEW v1.1.0)
reconciliation:
  enabled: true  # Auto-reconcile after each story
  require_confirmation: true  # Ask before applying changes
  update_sprint_status: true  # Sync sprint-status.yaml
```

---

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Load Sprint Status
- Parses sprint-status.yaml
- Filters stories with status="ready-for-dev"
- Excludes epics and retrospectives
- Optionally filters by epic number

### 2. Display Available Stories
- Shows all ready-for-dev stories
- Verifies story files exist
- Displays status icons and comments

### 2.5. 🆕 Validate and Create/Regenerate Stories (NEW v1.2.0)
**For each story:**
- Check file existence (multiple naming patterns)
- Validate 12 BMAD sections present
- Check content quality (Current State ≥100 words, gap analysis)
- **If missing:** Prompt to create with gap analysis
- **If invalid:** Prompt to regenerate with codebase scan
- **If valid:** Mark ready to process
- Remove skipped stories from selection

### 3. Get User Selection
- Interactive story picker
- Supports flexible selection syntax
- Validates selection and confirms

### 3.5. Choose Execution Strategy
- Sequential vs Parallel
- If parallel: choose concurrency level
- Confirm execution plan

### 4. Process Stories
**Sequential Mode:**
- For each selected story:
  - Invoke story-pipeline
  - Execute reconciliation (Step 4.5)
  - Report results
  - Pause between stories

**Parallel Mode (TeammateTool Swarm - v4.0.0):**
- Orchestrator creates a swarm team via `Teammate.spawnTeam()`
- Creates shared task list with `TaskCreate` per story, dependencies via `addBlockedBy`
- Spawns N Heracles teammates (default 3) that join the team
- Workers self-schedule: `TaskList` → claim unblocked task → execute pipeline → report → repeat
- No wave planning, no polling loops — workers get notified via `SendMessage`
- Dependencies enforced by task graph: workers skip blocked tasks automatically
- **Commit Queue:** File-based locking prevents git lock conflicts
  - Workers acquire `.git/pantheon-commit.lock` before committing
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff (1s → 30s)
  - Stale lock cleanup (>5 min)
  - Serialized commits, parallel implementation
- Orchestrator reconciles stories as completion messages arrive
- Workers shut down gracefully when no tasks remain
- Team cleaned up via `Teammate.cleanup()` at end

### 4.5. Smart Story Reconciliation (NEW)
**Executed after each story completes:**
- Load Dev Agent Record
- Analyze ACs/Tasks/DoD vs implementation
- Calculate completion percentages
- Determine correct story status
- Update checkboxes and status
- Sync sprint-status.yaml

See: `step-4.5-reconcile-story-status.md` for detailed algorithm

### 5. Display Batch Summary
- Shows completion statistics
- Lists failed stories (if any)
- Lists reconciliation warnings (if any)
- Provides next steps
- Saves batch log

---

## Output Files

### Batch Log

**Location:** `{{sprint_artifacts}}/batch-stories-{date}.log`

**Contains:**
- Start/end timestamps
- Selected stories
- Completed stories
- Failed stories
- Reconciliation warnings
- Success rate
- Total duration

### Reconciliation Results (per story)

**Embedded in Dev Agent Record:**
- Reconciliation summary
- Changes applied
- Final completion percentages
- Status determination reasoning

---

## Error Handling

### Story Implementation Fails
- Increments failed counter
- Adds to failed_stories list
- If `continue_on_failure=true`, continues with remaining stories
- If `continue_on_failure=false`, stops batch

### Reconciliation Fails
- Story still marked as completed (implementation succeeded)
- Adds to reconciliation_warnings list
- User warned to manually verify story accuracy
- Does NOT fail the batch

### Task Agent Fails (Parallel Mode)
- Collects error from TaskOutput
- Marks story as failed
- Continues with remaining stories in batch

---

## Best Practices

### Story Selection
- ✅ Start small: Process 2-3 stories first to verify workflow
- ✅ Group by epic: Related stories often share context
- ✅ Check file status: ✅ stories are ready, ❌ need creation first
- ❌ Don't process 20 stories at once on first run

### Execution Mode
- Sequential for ≤5 stories (easier monitoring)
- Parallel for >5 stories (faster completion)
- Use parallelism=2 first, then increase if stable

### During Execution
- Monitor progress output
- Check reconciliation reports
- Verify changes look correct
- Spot-check 1-2 completed stories

### After Completion
1. Review batch summary
2. Check reconciliation warnings
3. Verify sprint-status.yaml updated
4. Run tests: `pnpm test`
5. Check coverage: `pnpm test --coverage`
6. Review commits: `git log -<count>`
7. Spot-check 2-3 stories for quality

---

## Troubleshooting

### Reconciliation Reports Many Warnings

**Cause:** Dev Agent Record may be incomplete or stories weren't fully implemented

**Fix:**
1. Review listed stories manually
2. Check Dev Agent Record has all required sections
3. Re-run story-pipeline for problematic stories
4. Manually reconcile checkboxes if needed

### Parallel Mode Hangs

**Cause:** Too many agents running concurrently, system resources exhausted

**Fix:**
1. Kill hung agents: `/tasks` then `kill <task-id>`
2. Reduce parallelism: Use 2 instead of 4
3. Process remaining stories sequentially

### Story Marked "done" but has Unchecked Items

**Cause:** Reconciliation may have missed some checkboxes

**Fix:**
1. Review Dev Agent Record
2. Check which checkboxes should be checked
3. Manually check them or re-run reconciliation:
   - Load story file
   - Compare ACs/Tasks/DoD to Dev Agent Record
   - Update checkboxes to match reality
