# Parallel execution configuration (v5.0.0 — Lead-Driven Single-Story Workers)
# Replaces Agent Teams swarm with lead-managed background Task agents.
# Each worker is a background Task agent that processes ONE story in isolation.
# No shared task list, no inter-agent messaging, no self-scheduling.
parallel_config:
  max_workers: 3                # Maximum concurrent pipeline executors (background Task agents)

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # ARCHITECTURE
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Lead manages an in-memory queue. For each story:
  #   1. Lead spawns a background Task agent (Heracles) with ONE story assignment
  #   2. Agent executes the full 7-phase pipeline with sub-agent spawns
  #   3. Agent writes artifacts to completions/ directory
  #   4. Lead polls TaskOutput for completion, validates artifacts
  #   5. Lead accepts or rejects based on mandatory artifact checklist
  #
  # This eliminates batch awareness — workers cannot see other stories,
  # cannot self-schedule, and cannot optimize for throughput over depth.

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # ARTIFACT VALIDATION (Mandatory before accepting completion)
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Lead validates these artifacts exist before marking a story complete:
  #   1. {story_key}-progress.json — status == SUCCESS or ALREADY_DONE
  #   2. {story_key}-builder.json — with file:line evidence in tasks_addressed
  #   3. {story_key}-argus.json OR {story_key}-review.json — reviewer artifact
  #   4. {story_key}-themis.json — triage data
  #   5. {story_key}-reconciler.json — task completion counts
  #   6. Git commit with feat({story_key}) prefix
  # Missing artifacts → rejection, re-queue for retry (max 2 attempts)

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # TIMEOUT & RECOVERY
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  worker_retries: 2             # Retry failed/rejected stories (0 = no retry)
  circuit_breaker_threshold: 3  # Halt batch after 3 consecutive failures
