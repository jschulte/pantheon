# Story-Full-Pipeline v4.0 - Enhanced Multi-Agent Pipeline

<purpose>
Implement a story using parallel verification agents with Builder context reuse.
Enhanced with playbook learning, code citation evidence, test quality validation, and automated coverage gates.
Builder fixes issues in its own context (50-70% token savings).
</purpose>

<philosophy>
**Quality Through Discipline, Continuous Learning**

- Story Quality Gate: Fresh validation before committing resources
- Playbook Query: Load relevant patterns before starting
- Mason: Implements with playbook knowledge (context preserved)
- Vera + Tessa + Rex: Validate in parallel with evidence
- Coverage Gate: Automated threshold enforcement
- Mason: Refines issues in same context (50-70% token savings)
- Vera: Quick recheck
- Orchestrator: Reconciles mechanically
- Rita: Updates playbooks for future agents

Measure twice, cut once. Trust but verify. Evidence-based validation. Self-improving system.
</philosophy>

phases:

  phase_1: Mason the Craftsman (saves agent_id)
  phase_2: [Vera + Tessa + Rex reviewers] in parallel

reviewer_counts:
  micro: 2 reviewers (security, architect/integration)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 PHASE 0: STORY QUALITY GATE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Fresh validation before committing dev resources
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
\`\`\`

**Orchestrator performs these checks directly (no Task spawn):**

Read the story file with fresh eyes and validate:

**1. Required Sections Exist:**
\`\`\`bash
# Check for essential story structure
grep -q "## Story Title\|## Story:" "$STORY_FILE" || echo "❌ MISSING: Story Title"
grep -q "## Business Context\|## Context\|## Background" "$STORY_FILE" || echo "⚠️  MISSING: Business Context"
grep -q "## Acceptance Criteria\|## AC\|## Definition of Done" "$STORY_FILE" || echo "❌ MISSING: Acceptance Criteria"
grep -q "## Tasks\|## Implementation Tasks\|^- \[ \]" "$STORY_FILE" || echo "❌ MISSING: Tasks"
\`\`\`

**2. Tasks Are Well-Defined (not placeholders):**
\`\`\`bash
# Check for placeholder tasks
PLACEHOLDER_TASKS=$(grep -E "^\- \[ \] (TBD|TODO|WIP|Placeholder|...)" "$STORY_FILE" | wc -l)
if [ "$PLACEHOLDER_TASKS" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ BLOCKER: $PLACEHOLDER_TASKS placeholder tasks found"
  grep -E "^\- \[ \] (TBD|TODO|WIP|Placeholder|...)" "$STORY_FILE"
fi

# Check tasks have meaningful descriptions (> 10 chars)
SHORT_TASKS=$(grep "^- \[ \]" "$STORY_FILE" | awk 'length($0) < 20' | wc -l)
if [ "$SHORT_TASKS" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: $SHORT_TASKS tasks may be too brief"
fi
\`\`\`

**3. No Unresolved Blockers:**
\`\`\`bash
# Check for blocker markers
BLOCKERS=$(grep -ciE "\[BLOCKER\]|\[BLOCKED\]|\[NEEDS.DECISION\]|\[NEEDS.CLARIFICATION\]|\[UNRESOLVED\]" "$STORY_FILE")
if [ "$BLOCKERS" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ BLOCKER: $BLOCKERS unresolved blockers found"
  grep -iE "\[BLOCKER\]|\[BLOCKED\]|\[NEEDS.DECISION\]|\[NEEDS.CLARIFICATION\]|\[UNRESOLVED\]" "$STORY_FILE"
fi
\`\`\`

**4. Acceptance Criteria Are Testable:**
\`\`\`bash
# Count acceptance criteria
AC_COUNT=$(grep -cE "^\- \[ \].*should|^\- \[ \].*must|^\- \[ \].*can|^- Given.*When.*Then" "$STORY_FILE" || echo "0")
if [ "$AC_COUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: No testable acceptance criteria found (should/must/can/Given-When-Then)"
fi
\`\`\`

**5. Gap Analysis Status (brownfield check):**
\`\`\`bash
# If story references existing code, check gap analysis was done
if grep -q "existing\|modify\|update\|extend\|refactor" "$STORY_FILE"; then
  if ! grep -q "Gap Analysis\|Codebase Analysis\|## Existing Code" "$STORY_FILE"; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: Story references existing code but no gap analysis section found"
  fi
fi
\`\`\`

**Quality Gate Decision:**
\`\`\`
IF any ❌ BLOCKER found:
  → HALT pipeline
  → Report issues to user
  → Suggest: "Run /bmad_bmm_validate to fix story issues"

IF only ⚠️ WARNINGs found:
  → Display warnings to user
  → ASK: "Proceed despite warnings? [y/N]"
  → If user declines, halt pipeline

IF all checks pass:
  → Display "✅ Story quality gate passed"
  → Proceed to Phase 0.5 (Playbook Query)

- Path: \`docs/playbooks/implementation-playbooks/\`
- Output mode: files_with_matches

**Load matching playbooks:**

\`\`\`bash
# Stage story file and sprint status updates

git add docs/sprint-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml
git add docs/sprint-artifacts/completions/

# Create reconciliation commit
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

💡 PHASE 6: PLAYBOOK REFLECTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
\`\`\`

Spawn Reflection Agent:

\`\`\`
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "opus",
  description: "📚 Rita the Librarian reflecting on {{story_key}}",
  prompt: \`
You are the REFLECTION agent for story {{story_key}}.

<context>
Story: [inline story file]
Builder initial: [inline builder.json]
All review findings: [inline all reviewer artifacts]
Builder fixes: [inline builder-fixes.json]
Test quality issues: [inline test-quality.json]
</context>

<objective>
Identify what future agents should know:

1. **What issues were found?** (from reviewers)
2. **What did Builder miss initially?** (gaps, edge cases, security)
3. **What playbook knowledge would have prevented these?**
4. **Which module/feature area does this apply to?**
5. **Should we update existing playbook or create new?**

Questions:
- What gotchas should future builders know?
- What code patterns should be standard?
- What test requirements are essential?
- What similar stories exist?
</objective>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Analyzed review findings
- [ ] Identified preventable issues
- [ ] Determined which playbook(s) to update

If \`auto_apply_updates: true\` in config:
- Read playbook (or create from template if new)
- Use Edit tool to add learnings to sections
- Commit playbook update

If \`auto_apply_updates: false\` (default):
- Display proposal for manual review
- User can apply later with \`/update-playbooks {{story_key}}\`
</step>

</process>

<failure_handling>
**Builder fails (Phase 1):** Don't spawn verification. Report failure and halt.
**Inspector fails (Phase 2):** Still collect other reviewer findings.
**Test Quality fails:** Add issues to Builder fix list.
**Coverage below threshold:** Add to Builder fix list.
**Reviewers find CRITICAL:** Builder MUST fix when resumed.
**Inspector fails (Phase 4):** Resume Builder again (iterative loop, max 3 iterations).
**Builder resume fails:** Report unfixed issues. Manual intervention.
**Reconciliation fails:** Fix with Edit tool, re-verify.

<improvements_v4>
1. ✅ Resume Builder for fixes (v3.2+) - 50-70% token savings
2. ✅ Inspector provides code citations (v4.0) - file:line evidence for every task
3. ✅ Removed "hospital-grade" framing (v4.0) - kept disciplined gates
4. ✅ Micro stories get 2 reviewers + security scan (v3.2+) - not zero
5. ✅ Test Quality Agent (v4.0) + Coverage Gate (v4.0) - validates test quality and enforces threshold
6. ✅ Playbook query (v4.0) before Builder + reflection (v4.0) after - continuous learning
7. ✅ Reconciliation commit (v4.2) - commits story file updates after validation
