description: "Enhanced multi-agent pipeline with playbook learning, code citation evidence, test quality validation, and resume-builder fixes"
author: "BMAD Method"
version: "4.1.0" # Added execution discipline documentation

# ============================================================================
# CRITICAL: EXECUTION DISCIPLINE
# ============================================================================
# This workflow MUST be invoked via the Skill tool (/bmad_bse_story-pipeline)
# The orchestrator (main Claude context) follows workflow.md phases.
#
# Task subagent_types listed below are ONLY for phases defined in workflow.md:
#   - Phase 1: builder (Mason)
#   - Phase 2: inspector, test_quality, reviewers (Vera, Tessa, Rex)
#   - Phase 3: fixer (Mason resumed)
#   - Phase 4: inspector (Vera re-check)
#   - Phase 6: reflection (Rita)
#
# DO NOT use Task tool outside the workflow phases!
# DO NOT spawn ad-hoc Task agents to "implement" stories directly!
# The workflow structure exists to ensure proper verification.
# ============================================================================
